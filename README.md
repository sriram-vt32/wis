## What did I learn?

there is a bunch of informative stuff that I came across while doing this assignment. I have learnt what basically git is and different functions present in it such as 

- Repositories
- Cloning
- Commit and push
- Branches
- Fork
- Pull request

Firstly we choose the repositry we want to work on and later clone the repo and sync it. Once it is cloned we select the branch we want to work on and pull the files in the branch,later we can add or make changes to the code once we pull. After we are done with editing we commit and push back the code into the branch  

Another function we learned about is fork .In the case where we want to contribute work to other's repo we use fork. we basically make a copy of the repo to work on without effecting the original files of the repo. we can use this to freely experiment our changes in that repo.

One thing we need to keep in mind is that we should make sure that our **code lines dont _conflict_ while pushing the code to the repo**. Git gives an option to overwrite the conflicted areas but we need to see this step with extreme caution as we could loose our teammates or personal valuable code if overwritten. In general we write our code in such a manner that it wouldn't conflict.

Last but not least we learn about **Markdown**. We learn how to use different styles in it so we can style our issues or pull request. This helps in organizing and easy to work on. we can use the markdown the create our profile and describe about ourselves or contributions we have made so far. This help other about having an insight about us.
